        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <h2>How I use #62,500 to build a business</h2><h2> that generated over $5000 in 4 months.</h2>
        <p class=" "> 


Before now, I use to be a broke Corper earning 33k stipend though I had rich mentality.



I was told to go to school, graduate from college and get a good paying job.



I did same thing I was told to do but my mindset about job changed after my industrial attachment experience.



My experience securing a place for my industrial attachment as an engineering student was terrible. That’s a story for another day.



Just like most people, I graduated with Second Class Upper Division and searched for job and finally got one.



Honestly I never knew this was the experience people are facing in their work place,  I was used, had no time for myself and the take home salary couldn’t take me home since I was the first born of my family with other responsibilities.



I started other businesses like forex and lost money, invested in crypto and didn’t succeed.



At some point the source of livelihood was rarely in sight.



One day I came in contact with an book written by Toyin Omotoso on how I can turn myself to a live breathing cash machine.



I digested the book and there was a recommendation from my mentor Toyin Omotoso on how I can implement the same knowledge I got from the book. I followed through the recommendation and everything changed for me. 



This was how the journey began, few months down the line and have generated over $5000 in four months and have equally helped most of my students do the same.



I want to show you step by step on how I did it and most importantly how you can do it too. 



If you want to learn this same exact strategy that took me from 33K as a Corper to making over $5000 in 4months then write me on WhatsApp by clicking on the link wa.link/sa4tg1 and I promise to share the same book I read worth $15 with you as a free gift.
